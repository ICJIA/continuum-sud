	<summary>COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES</summary>

**Description:** Cognitive and behavioral therapies include those that reinforce and provide incentives for abstinence, enhancing life and coping skills surrounding situations and emotions that may trigger drug use, and help change attitudes and behaviors related to substance use. Some therapies focus more on the behavioral aspect of substance use; some focus more on the cognitive aspect of substance use. Others use both approaches, called cognitive-behavioral therapy.[^1] Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a general classification of therapeutic techniques that focus on two aspects: 

 - The thought processes, attitudes, and values underlying antisocial behavior (cognitive).
 - The observable behaviors (behavioral).

Ultimately, CBT helps individuals understand how thoughts and feelings influence choices in behavior, in addition to providing behavioral alternatives. In order to help change antisocial behavior, such as substance use, CBT helps individuals identify and replace thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs that lead may to substance use.[^2]    Further, CBT helps individuals by teaching social and emotional skills, while also using positive and negative consequences to shape behavior. This helps provide tools for individuals to use when encountering situations that may lead to substance use or other antisocial behaviors.[^3]   CBT incorporates several distinct interventions that may be used alone or in combination, in an individual or group format. In particular, CBT incorporates some combination of

 - cognitive restructuring;
 - social skill building;
 - emotional regulation skills;
 - modeling and role-playing; 
 - homework assignments;
 - motivational enhancement/interviewing techniques;
 - contingency management principles;
 - psychoeducation; and
 - systematic training of alternative responses to triggers (high-risk situations).[^4]  

Some treatment focuses more on cognitions (considered cognitive therapy), some more on behaviors (considered behavioral therapy), and some provide a balance of both (considered cognitive-behavioral therapy).[^5]   

Behavioral and CBT-based treatment can take several forms in the community (but is not limited to):

 -  Individual, family, or group-based.
 - Residential, inpatient treatment.
 - Outpatient or intensive outpatient programs (IOP).

In addition, it is also beneficial for treatment to be supplemented with other support services:
 - Educational and vocational training.
 - Self-help or peer recovery support services.
 - Mental health services. [^6] 

----------

**Goals:**

 - Develop and increase use of appropriate social and emotional skills.
 - Understand how thinking leads to behavior.
 - Target maladaptive thinking patterns.
 - Improve moral and critical reasoning.
 - Develop and use interpersonal skills.
 - Manage or cope with risky situations that may lead to relapse.
 - Increase self-control and impulse management. 
 - Increase public safety and community safety.
 - Increase number of individuals in the workforce. 
 - Increase self-efficacy and self-control.[^7]  

----------
**Eligibility:**  Ideally, eligibility should be based on a validated clinical tool or validated risk/needs assessment conducted by trained professionals. Examples of assessments facilitated by trained clinicians include:

 - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/products/assessment-and-evaluation). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
 - [DAST -10](https://cde.drugabuse.gov/instrument/e9053390-ee9c-9140-e040-bb89ad433d69) (free).
 - [NIDA’s Drug Screening Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/) (free).[^8] 
 - [Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/66_SASSI.pdf) (SASSI). 
 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^9]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).

 - [Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)](http://gaincc.org/instruments/).[^10]  
 - [Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS)](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/downloads/Risk-Needs-Assessment.pdf). 
 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](https://cech.uc.edu/centers/ucci/services/trainings/offender_assessment/orastrainingoverview.html).[^11]     


----------
**Program Examples:**
The programs below have substantial and rigorous research identifying them as ***effective*** behavioral intervention programs. This is not a comprehensive list.

**[Relapse Prevention (RP)](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/151-160.pdf)** is a CBT-based program that specifically and systematically trains individuals to engage in alternate responses to high-risk situations related to substance use.[^12]   RP incorporates the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies to reduce relapse through identification of “triggers”— individually specific high-risk situations that may precede or contribute to relapse.[^13]  Additional aspects of RP include

 - enhancing self-efficacy;
 - managing relapses;
 - identifying and coping with high-risk situations;
 - eliminating myths and placebo effects (countering misperceptions of use); and
 - balancing and modifying lifestyle factors.[^14] 

**[Contingency management (CM)](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/122-127.pdf)** is an incentive-based intervention with a behavioral focus that uses reinforcements to meet specific behavioral goals such as remaining clean and sober, providing negative urine screens, or completing treatment sessions.[^15]  Reinforcements shape or control behavior through consequences and non-drug-related reinforcers to help counter the reinforcing effects of drugs.[^16]  Two common types of CM programs:

•	*Voucher-Based Reinforcement Therapy (VBRT)* which uses vouchers with differing monetary values each time an individual engages in specific positive behaviors that may be exchanged for goods or services.[^17]   
•	*Prize-Based (PB) contingency management* which uses a drawing for a prize when an individual engages in positive behavior, but not all drawings will result in a tangible prize.[^18]   


----------
**Research findings.** CBT and behavioral therapies are effective types of treatment, that generally has a moderate effect on reducing

 - substance use; 
 - substance abuse; and
 - reoffending.[^19]  

Further, research indicates that CBT and behavioral intervention programs can be more effective than

 - abstinence-based approaches;
 - standard case management; and
 - 12-step counseling.[^20]

Research also suggests that behavioral therapies with CM can result in more positive outcomes than behavioral interventions alone.[^21]  

In a meta-analysis, CBT showed a 26 percent reduction in recidivism for CBT program participants compared to a control group.[^22]  Further, CBT-based programs are effective with a variety of individuals, including those with SUDs or substance abuse/misuse.[^23]  

Behavioral (including CBT) programs or interventions produce the greatest effects when they adhere to the following principles:

 - Target those at *higher-risk to recidivate* (moderate- and high-risk) based on a validated risk/needs assessment.
 - Target *criminogenic risk factors* most highly associated with recidivism based on a validated risk/needs assessment.
 - Are *responsive* to individual needs and barriers (i.e. language, mental health, intellectual or cognitive disabilities).
 - Use *well-trained* professionals.
 - Maintain *adherence to the program or practice components* (fidelity, or using a program or practice as it is meant to be delivered based on training).[^24]

	<summary>PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS: MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT)</summary>

**Description:**   [Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) programs](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment) incorporate the use of medicine to treat opioid or alcohol use disorders, in conjunction with behavioral therapies or counseling to treat individuals with SUDs.[^25]  With regard to opioids, the use of medication alone is called opioid replacement therapy (ORT), which alone, can also be effective to treat opioid use disorders (OUDs).[^26] MAT programs help with treatment retention and abstinence by decreasing withdrawal symptoms and cravings; increasing quality of life; reducing risk of HIV and hepatitis C; reducing risky behaviors associated with substance use; as well as decreasing risk for overdose.[^27]   MAT programs can be in the community (healthcare office, methadone maintenance clinic, primary care physicians’ office, certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs)) or [correctional settings](http://nicic.gov/topics/5288-medication-assisted-treatment-mat-in-corrections).[^28]  Each type of medication for MAT is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and is most effective when coupled with other counseling or therapy services for SUDs; however, research also suggests benefits from medication alone without counseling.[^29]  

***Medications to treat Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs)***

**[Buprenporphine](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine)** offers a partial opioid agonist, producing similar, but lessened, effects of opiates. To increase the safety of buprenorphine and decrease the likelihood of diversion or misuse, naloxone—an opioid receptor blocker—is added to the medication.[^30]  Medications include 

 - Bunavail® (buccal film);
 - Suboxone® (film);
 - Zubsolv® (sublingual tablets);
 - Subutex® (transmucosal); 
 - Buprenex® (intramuscular or intravenous);
 - Butrans® (transdermal patch); and
 - Probuphine® (implant).[^31]   

Medication is prescribed and administered by a physician trained by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and given a special license and waiver by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The medication can be administered in an office, hospital, health department, or correctional facility.[^32]  Physicians can prescribe only to a limited number of patients—275—per the Federal Registrar, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSS).[^33]  

[**Methadone**](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/methadone) uses a synthetic opioid agonist taken in pill, liquid, or water form once a day. An opioid agonist tricks the brain and body as if it were taking opiates, without adverse side effects in order to reduce physiological cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  First administered and monitored by a physician, it then can be obtained through an [opioid treatment program (OTP)](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/opioid-treatment-programs) certified by the SAMHSA.[^34]  Methadone can be addictive, so it must be taken as prescribed to prevent adverse effects.[^35] 

[**Naltrexone**](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/naltrexone) is an opioid antagonist, blocking receptors in the brain from responding to opioids (or alcohol) and comes in pill (ReVia®, Depade®) or extended-release injectable (Vivitrol®) forms.[^36]  Any healthcare professional that is licensed to prescribe medications can prescribe naltrexone, without additional training.[^37] 

However, research on the use of naltrexone for OUDs is more limited than methadone and buprenorphine, particularly regarding rigorous, generalizable, long-term evaluations. While promising, more research is needed as to long-term outcomes.[^38]

***Medications to treat Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs)***

In addition [Naltrexone](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/naltrexone) can be used for AUDs, as it mediates or blocks the opioid activity within the brain related to alcohol use (see description above in OUDs).

**[Disulfiram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64036/)** is an alcohol abuse deterrent prescription medication taken daily in tablet form (Antabuse). When combined with alcohol, it causes severe physical reactions (i.e. heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, flushing). It is only effective if the individual is compliant with taking the medication.[^39]

**[Acamprosate](https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/MS974/MS974.pdf)** is a prescription drug taken orally (Campral®) that helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by normalizing alcohol-related neurochemical changes in the brain.[^40]  It targets neurochemical systems that may be biological factors of alcohol dependence.[^41]  


----------
**Goals:**

 - Reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms related to substance use.
 - Reduce risk for overdose.
 - Reduce substance use and relapse. 
 - Increase treatment retention.
 - Decrease illegal activity.
 - Increase positive outcomes related to health (HIV, Hepatitis C).
 - Increase abstinence rates.[^42] 
 - Improve patient survival.[^43] 


----------
**Eligibility:** Individuals with opioid or alcohol use disorders may be eligible for MAT programs. Individuals should be assessed with a clinical and validated substance abuse tool that includes assessment of medical, psychiatric, and substance use history; an evaluation of family and psychosocial supports; assessment of the state’s prescription drug monitoring program for detection of unreported use of other medications; a physical exam, and testing for recent opioid use and/or other drugs.[^44]  Some examples of assessments using self-report answers facilitated by trained clinicians include:

 - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/products/assessment-and-evaluation). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
 - [DAST -10](https://cde.drugabuse.gov/instrument/e9053390-ee9c-9140-e040-bb89ad433d69) (free).

 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^46]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).

 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](https://cech.uc.edu/centers/ucci/services/trainings/offender_assessment/orastrainingoverview.html).[^48]     

In a medical setting, [physicians can ask patients](http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/mat/RAND_MAT_guidebook_for_health_centers.pdf) about compulsive drug or alcohol use or loss of control over drinking or drug use during the past year.[^49]  It is also important to consider insurance coverage related to MAT programs (specifically, for the medications) for funding purposes, or other outside funding sources including low-cost drug programs, to help supplement those who may not be covered. 


----------
**Research on medications to treat OUDs**

[Methadone](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=158) can

 - decrease heroin and other opioid use; 
 - decrease use of injection;
 - decrease in crime/criminal behavior;  
 - improve social functioning and physical symptoms;[^50]  and
 - improve maternal and fetal outcomes for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.[^51]


[Buprenorphine](https://www.crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=170) can

 - significantly decrease in opioid use;
 - increase in overall well-being and social functioning;
 - reduce potential to contract HIV or hepatitis B or C;
 - decrease mortality;[^52] and 
 - decrease cravings and withdrawal symptoms.[^53]  

Naltrexone (extended-release injectable) for OUDs can

 - increase abstinence, and
 - increase retention in treatment.[^54]  
 
**Research on medications to treat AUDs**

Naltrexone for alcohol can

 - reduce drinking;
 - reduce rewarding effects of alcohol; and 
 - increase days abstinent.[^55] 

Disulfiram (Antabuse) can

 - be more effective than a placebo for sobriety;[^56]  
 - have a moderate effect on short-term abstinence;[^57]  
 - be most effective with those who are already motivated to stop drinking;[^58]  and
 - be most effective with close monitoring for better outcomes.[^59] 

Acomprosate can

 - decrease withdrawal symptoms; and
 - increase abstinence for those already motivated.[^60] 

Research also suggests the importance of MAT programs within correctional institutions for those transitioning from jail or prison into the community—as it can help

- reduce recidivism;  
- increase offender engagement and retention in treatment; and  
- reduce risk for relapse and/or overdose.[^61]

	<summary>RESEARCH UPDATE--PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS: MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT)</summary>

New research indicates patient success in the use of extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol®) for medication-assisted treatment. While buprenorphine and methadone remain the gold standard for treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs), naltrexone appears to have a place in treating OUDs with some success.[^62]

In a 2017 study, researchers employed a 24-week, randomized, controlled clinical trial at eight U.S. community-based inpatient services and followed up with participants as outpatients. A total of 570 participants with an OUD were randomly assigned to use Vivitrol® (n=283) or Suboxone® (n=287).

Researchers found that while both medications can be effective for treating OUDs, it was substantially more difficult to initiate patients on Vivitrol® due to the required prior detoxification period of at least three days (though this varies by individual) and opioid-negative urine screen. Full detoxification is not necessary for those inducted on Suboxone® and was not required in this study.

The study found for the 570 who agreed to take part in the study, 238 participants were assigned to take Vivitrol® and 287 participants were assigned to take Suboxone®. Researchers found: 

+ Most on Suboxone successfully initiated treatment (94 percent; n=270), while those on Vivitrol® had less success, with 72 percent successfully initiating (n=204). 
+ 65 percent of participants on Vivitrol® experienced relapse events, defined by four consecutive missing urine screens, compared to 57 percent of participants on Suboxone®.[^63]

The study found of the 474 successfully initiated individuals to treatment using Vivitrol® (n=204) or Suboxone® (n=270):

+ Similar results were seen among the participants receiving the two types of medications on outcomes of opioid-negative screens and opioid-abstinent days. 
+ Initially, those taking Vivitrol® self-reported fewer cravings; however, by 24 weeks no difference was noted between the two groups.
+ For both groups, the challenge of medication retention remained.[^64]

The results of this study aligned with a 2015 Norwegian study comparing Vivitrol® and Suboxone®.[^65] In that study, 159 adult opioid-dependent patients were randomly assigned to Vivitrol® (n=80) or Suboxone® (n=79) in a 12-week, randomized clinical trial. Of those, 71 ultimately received Vivitrol® as assigned and 72 were received Suboxone® as assigned.

Overall, researchers found:

+ Similar retention time on the medication between both groups. 
+ No difference in opioid use and adverse event outcomes between both groups.
+ Overall, there was similar short-term abstinence from illicit drugs for both groups, including illicit use. [^66]

These studies support the need for pharmacological options to treat substance use disorders when medically appropriate, including opioid use disorders. Treatment should be individualized and increased patient access is needed for all medications: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.
