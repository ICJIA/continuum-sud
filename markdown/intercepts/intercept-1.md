	<summary>OPIOID OVERDOSE REVERSAL</summary>

**Description:**  Naloxone, a medication that can be administered by nasal spray or injection, can be administered to an individual to reverse an opioid overdose. Naloxone blocks opioid receptor sites in the brain for up to 90 minutes to reverse respiratory distress.[^1]  Use of naloxone is and effective practice in reducing overdose fatalities. However, further research should be conducted as to follow-ups to non-fatal overdoses and how those individuals may or may not benefit from connection to appropriate services.

**Goals:** 

 - Prevent death from opioid-related overdose.
 - Increase the use of harm reduction tactics related to opioid use.

----------
**Eligibility:** First responders, including law enforcement, and laypersons can administer naloxone to an individual who may be overdosing on opioids (including heroin).

**Research findings:**

 - A study of 2,912 individuals in 19 communities over seven years, found communities with naloxone programs had significantly lower opioid overdose fatalities than those that did not.[^2]  
 - Further, this study found that take-home naloxone coupled with educational and training interventions significantly decreased overdose-related deaths by 54 to 73 per 100,000 over a 7-year period.[^3] 
 - A meta-analysis of 21 studies suggests that among available studies, naloxone provisions among drug users and their caregivers can be an effective strategy to combat fatal overdoses.[^4]

**Medication types:** generic name is naloxone; brand names include Narcan® and Evzio®.

**Examples in the field:**  These programs help provide information, training, and distribution of naloxone and naloxone use, in addition to other harm reduction strategies (i.e. syringe exchanges, overdose awareness, and health-related issues like Hepatitis C).[^5]  The following are examples of naloxone distribution and training locations:

 - [Illinois Department of Human Services Drug Overdose Prevention Program.](http://www.dhs.state.il.us/page.aspx?item=58142) 
 - [Stop Overdose IL.](http://stopoverdoseil.org/naloxone.html) 
 - Overdose Response Program out of Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). 
 - Deaths Avoided with Naloxone (DAWN) in Ohio. 
 - North Carolina Harm Reduction Coalition (NCHRC). 
 - In addition to other state and local police department naloxone programs.

	<summary>LAW ENFORCEMENT DEFLECTION INITIATIVES</summary>

**Description:** Law enforcement deflection initiatives help individuals with SUDs access treatment. Individuals—without fear of arrest—can ask for assistance in receiving substance use treatment.[^6]  A law enforcement officer completes an intake and arranges for transport to services for further clinical assessment as to appropriate treatment (or clinician may be on-site at the police station), typically by a volunteer.[^7]  These initiatives feature collaboration between law enforcement, the community, hospitals, public health providers, substance use treatment providers, and other community service providers.

**Goals:** 

 - Intervene in cycle of substance use and potential crime or criminal justice involvement.
 - Improve public safety.


----------
**Eligibility:** Some departments have selected the following as criteria for assistance:

 - Voluntarily ask for assistance.
 - Turn in drugs and/or drug paraphernalia (if applicable).
 - Consent from a parent or guardian if a juvenile.
 - Pose no threat to person transporting to treatment.
 - No outstanding warrants.
 - Have no more than three prior drug-related arrests.
 - No prior arrest for possession with intent to distribute, trafficking, or have a drug violation in a school zone.[^8]

**Research/evidence:**  These are ***promising initiatives***, but there currently is not enough substantial research to identify these practices as evidence-based. In an analysis of 200 participants of ANGEL initiative in Gloucester, Mass. pre-arrest diversion program, researchers reported 70 percent completed treatment and follow-up services. However, out of 100 of those individuals, 40 percent had returned to substance use.[^9]  

Preliminary data indicates a

 - reduction in fatal drug overdoses; and
 - 31 percent decrease in drug-related crime.[^10]  

**Examples in the field:** At least 140 law enforcement agencies in 25 states have joined PAARI to create initiatives, including:

 - ANGEL (Gloucester, Mass.).
 - ANGEL/Hope (North Carolina). 
 - A Way Out (Lake County, Ill.).
 - Safe Passage (Lee, Livingston, Whiteside Counties, Ill.).

The [Arlington Outreach Model](http://paariusa.org/arlington/) (Arlington, Mass.) and [Conversations for Change](http://www.east-end.org/2016/09/08/conversation-for-change-2/) (Dayton, Ohio) are both  slightly different initiatives that are generally more proactive in connecting individuals with SUD to treatment and services through outreach to those in need.

	<summary>PRE-BOOKING COMMUNITY-BASED DIVERSION</summary>
	
**Description:** Police may exercise discretion to divert individuals with potential SUDs or other substance use issues in lieu of standard jail booking and criminal justice prosecution for non-violent, non-felony offenses.[^11]  An arresting officer goes through initial arrest protocols (arresting person, writing case report, collecting evidence), but then flags the case and asks the prosecutor to not immediately file charges.[^12]  The arrestee is assigned a case manager who facilitates an entry evaluation and refers them to a variety of services that can include 

 - substance use treatment and/or services; 
 - housing assistance;
 - job and educational services; 
 - legal advocacy; and/or 
 - counseling.[^13]  

The individual may be prosecuted if he/she does not initiate services within 30 days from entry evaluation.[^14]  Programs may operate similar to this, but as deferred prosecution programs. However, there is limited research related to deferred prosecution programs.

**Goals:** 

 - Divert to treatment rather than jail and prosecution to individuals with SUDs. 
 - Intervene in cycle of substance use, crime, and criminal justice involvement.
 - Reduce recidivism.
 - Decrease monetary costs for criminal justice system. 
 - Improve public safety.
 - Improve public health. 
 - Reduce reliance on formal criminal justice processing
 - Long-term behavioral changes--which may or may not include complete abstinence (harm reduction approach instead of zero-tolerance approach).[^15]
 
 
----------
**Eligibility:** Example eligibility criteria from the Law Enforcement-Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program out of Seattle, Washington is as follows:

 - Individual suspected of a controlled substance offense, prostitution offense, or minor property crime offenses related to substance use (non-violent and non-felony).
 - Police believe individual is amenable to diversion.
 - Offense does not involve delivery, possession with intent to deliver, or dealing with intent to profit.
 - Offense does not involve exploitation of minors in dealing or distributing drugs.
 - Offense does not involve promotion of prostitution.
 - Individual does not have  previous convictions for murder, arson, robbery, assault, kidnapping, sex offense, or attempt of any of these crimes (this may vary by department and may include other offenses like domestic violence within a specific time-frame). 
 - Individual has not participated or is not currently participating in other criminal justice diversion programs.
 - The individual is willing to participate.[^16]

**Research/evidence:** To date, the [Law Enforcement-Assisted Diversion (LEAD)](http://www.leadbureau.org/resources) program in Seattle has been the only such program evaluated extensively with a [report on recidivism , criminal and legal system costs and utilization, client outcomes (housing, employment, income/benefits)](http://media.wix.com/ugd/6f124f_8183d4c04a09456cb48f92875ab2e188.pdf). LEAD is a ***promising program***; there currently is not enough substantial research to identify it as evidence-based. During the first six months of evaluation, 30 percent of LEAD participants were less likely to be arrested compared to the control group.[^17]  After a little more than four years, participants were 58 percent less likely to be arrested compared to the control group after their entry evaluation.[^18]  Participants subsequent to entry into LEAD, on average, demonstrated significantly lower likelihood of 

 - felony cases (64 percent); 
 - King County jail bookings (69 percent); 
 - days in jail (68 percent); and 
 - days in state prison (87 percent).[^19]  

In addition, it costs less to connect people to services via LEAD than it does to formally process them into the criminal justice system.[^20]  The cost of LEAD participants from pre to post entry evaluation, cost reductions were \$2,100 , whereas the control group (system-as-usual) demonstrated cost increases (\$5,961). After initial start-up of LEAD, program costs decreased from \$899 per month to \$532 per month.[^21]  Further, the program had a positive effect on participants’ income and housing.[^22]

**Examples in the field:** Many agencies are developing programs similar to the LEAD program in Seattle and the following are operational: 

 - Santa Fe, N. M.
 - Albany, N.Y.
 - Huntington, W. Va. 
 - Canton, Ohio. 

Several others are in final stages of implementation: 

 - Baltimore, Md. 
 - Portland, Maine. 
 - San Francisco.
 - Atlanta (DeKalb & Fulton counties).[^23]
