**Description:**  Police officers are often called on to respond to incidents in which an individual is experiencing a mental health crisis. Many police departments have developed specialized responses for the incidents to divert individuals away from the criminal justice system and connect them to mental health treatment. Two common specialized response models are: 

- The crisis intervention team (CIT) model involves specialized training for officers and partnerships with mental health service providers in the community. 
- The co-responder model utilizes mental health professionals in the field with officers to assist in de-escalating crisis situations and facilitate access to treatment.[^1]  

Departments may incorporate mental health services in other ways for crisis incidents. However, empirical research is limited outside of the CIT and co-responder models.[^2]

**Goals:**

- Reduce unnecessary involvement with the criminal justice system.[^3]
- Increase access to mental health treatment.[^4]
- Reduce injuries to individuals in crisis.[^5]
- Reduce injuries to officers.[^6]
- More efficient disposition of mental health calls for service.[^7]

**Eligibility:**
Officers have significant discretion when determining the disposition of a call for service, and eligibility for pre-arrest diversion following a mental health crisis incident is also often dependent on officer discretion.[^8] Examples of eligibility criteria for pre-arrest diversion include:

- Exhibiting psychiatric symptoms.
- Nonviolent alleged offense.[^9]

Note: Emergency communications personnel should be trained to identify calls for service related to individuals experiencing a mental health crisis and trained to dispatch a CIT officer or a co-responder team.[^10]

**Research Evidence:**
Despite widespread adoption of the CIT model in police departments across the country, there is a dearth of rigorous research evaluating these programs. CIT can be considered evidence-based with respect to the outcome of improved officer knowledge and attitudes toward individuals with MHDs.[^11] More research is required before CIT can be considered evidence-based in achieving other outcomes. Research findings related to CIT outcomes include the following:

- CIT-trained officers have greater knowledge of MHDs and more positive attitudes toward individuals with MHDs.[^12]
- Officers with CIT training are more likely to facilitate access to mental health treatment and services.[^13]
- There is no evidence to suggest CIT officers are less likely to arrest individuals with MHDs.[^14]
- At least one study suggests CIT-trained officers are less likely to use force in response to mental health crisis incidents.[^15]
- There is no evidence to suggest individuals receiving a specialized response are less likely to reoffend.[^16]

The [Washington State Institute for Public Policy](http://www.wsipp.wa.gov/) (WSIPP) examines programs to analyze the ratio of benefits to costs in monetary values. After examining pre-arrest diversion programs that follow the CIT model, WSIPP reported that the benefit-to-cost ratio was a loss of $2.94 for every $1 spent.[^17] The group also noted that there was only a 1-percent chance that this type of program would produce benefits greater than the total cost.[^18]

Co-responder programs have been less frequently researched; however, emerging evidence suggests that this model has potential to be effective in achieving the desired outcomes of pre-arrest diversion for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis. A review of co-responder programs found the model to be successful in:

- Connecting individuals in crisis with community mental health services.
- Reducing police department resources expended on mental health crisis incidents.[^19]

There is a small amount of evidence regarding the co-responder model’s impact on other outcomes, showing:

- Police attitudes toward individuals with MHDs improved.[^20]
- The number of individuals admitted to mental health facilities decreased.[^21]
- More positive perceptions were created of both the police response and the mental health system for officers and consumers alike.[^22]

**Examples in the Field:**  Police departments across the nation are adopting the CIT program model at a fast pace.[^23] Programs that have been evaluated thoroughly include:

-	[Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Program](http://directives.chicagopolice.org/directives/data/a7a57bf0-12d103eb-84112-d103-f1bd3a851b8bc48e.html) in Chicago.
-	[The “Memphis Model” Crisis Intervention Team](https://www.memphispolice.org/initiatives.asp), in Memphis, Tenn.


While co-responder programs are less common, well-established programs include:

-	Mental Health Crisis Unit in Knoxville, Tenn.[^24]
-	[Mobile Crisis Service](https://dekcsb.org/crisis/) in DeKalb County, Ga. 
-	[Systemwide Mental Assessment Response Team (SMART)](http://www.lapdonline.org/detective_bureau/content_basic_view/51704) in Los Angeles, Calif.
