## DRUG COURT

**Description:**  Drug court probation features

 - frequent drug tests;
 - weekly and/or monthly appearances before the drug court judge;
 - meetings with case manager(s);
 - participation in treatment programs deemed appropriate for the individual; and
 - use of graduated sanctions and incentives.[^1]

Drug court participants move through a phase process, ending in the participants' graduation from drug court. Phase progression is generally based on

 - time in the program;
 - number of clean/sober days; and
 - cooperation and participation in their individualized drug court program including substance use disorder treatment and other services.[^2]

The 10 key components of drug court can be found [here](http://www.nadcp.org/sites/default/files/nadcp/10%20Key%20Components.pdf).

----------
**Goals:** 
 - Reduce substance use.
 - Reduce recidivism.
 - Increase treatment retention.
 - Decrease criminal justice costs--reduced victimization and costs related to healthcare, incarceration, and recidivism.
 - Reunite families.[^3]

----------
**Eligibility:** Eligibility criteria varies by state and jurisdiction, but generally, non-violent offenders charged with drug or drug-related (or drug-driven) offenses are eligible.[^4]  Who refers cases (public defender, private attorney, state’s attorney, or probation officer) varies by state and local jurisdiction. Ideally, eligibility should be based on a clinical and validated tool or validated risk/needs assessment by a trained criminal justice professional for referral to appropriate services. Examples of assessments  facilitated by trained clinicians include: 

* [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals/). 
* [Opioid Risk Tool ](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
* [DAST-10 ](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/DAST-10.pdf) (free).
* [NIDA’s Drug Screening Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/)  (free).[^5] 
* [Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI)](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/66_SASSI.pdf). 
* [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^6]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

* [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
* [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).
* [Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LSCMI)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=ls-cmi). 
* [Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)](http://gaincc.org/instruments/).[^7]  
*[Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS)](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/downloads/Risk-Needs-Assessment.pdf). 
* [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](http://www.uc.edu/corrections/services/trainings/offender_assessment.html)(non-propriety, but costs for training).[^8]     


**Research findings:** Drug courts are considered an *effective* practice when implemented with fidelity. Research on drug courts indicates that, compared to those on standard probation, drug court participation

 - moderately reduced recidivism depending on drug court implementation; 
 - reduced recidivism—10 to 15 percent,[^9]  lasting three to 14 years;[^10]
 - reduced incarceration rates; 
 - increased time to re-arrest; 
 - decreased frequent re-arrest; and 
 - decreased drug use and positive drug tests.[^11]  

**Program examples:** According to the [National Association for Drug Court Professionals](http://www.nadcp.org/), as of December 2014, there were 2,734 drug courts, servicing over 136,000 individuals. According to the [Illinois Center of Excellence for Behavioral Health and Justice](http://www.illinoiscenterofexcellence.org/), Illinois has 116 adult drug courts (including hybrid DWI courts), 7 juvenile drug courts, in addition to other types of problem-solving courts.

## COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES [^12]

**Description:** Cognitive and behavioral therapies include those that reinforce and provide incentives for abstinence, enhancing life and coping skills surrounding situations and emotions that may trigger drug use, and help change attitudes and behaviors related to substance use. Some therapies focus more on the behavioral aspect of substance use; some focus more on the cognitive aspect of substance use. Others use both approaches, called cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a general classification of therapeutic techniques that focus on two aspects: 

 - The thought processes, attitudes, and values underlying antisocial behavior (cognitive).
 - The observable behaviors (behavioral).

Ultimately, CBT helps individuals understand how thoughts and feelings influence choices in behavior, in addition to providing behavioral alternatives. In order to help change antisocial behavior, such as substance use, CBT helps individuals identify and replace thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs that lead may to substance use.[^13]    Further, CBT helps individuals by teaching social and emotional skills, while also using positive and negative consequences to shape behavior. This helps provide tools for individuals to use when encountering situations that may lead to substance use or other antisocial behaviors.[^14]   CBT incorporates several distinct interventions that may be used alone or in combination, in an individual or group format. In particular, CBT incorporates some combination of

 - cognitive restructuring;
 - social skill building;
 - emotional regulation skills;
 - modeling and role-playing; 
 - homework assignments;
 - motivational enhancement/interviewing techniques;
 - contingency management principles;
 - psychoeducation; and
 - systematic training of alternative responses to triggers (high-risk situations).[^15]  

Some treatment focuses more on cognitions (considered cognitive therapy), some more on behaviors (considered behavioral therapy), and some provide a balance of both (considered cognitive-behavioral therapy).[^16]   

**Goals:**

 - Develop and increase use of appropriate social and emotional skills.
 - Understand how thinking leads to behavior.
 - Target maladaptive thinking patterns.
 - Improve moral and critical reasoning.
 - Develop and use interpersonal skills.
 - Manage or cope with risky situations that may lead to relapse.
 - Increase self-control and impulse management. 
 - Increase public safety and community safety.
 - Increase number of individuals in the workforce. 
 - Increase self-efficacy and self-control.[^17]  

----------
**Eligibility:**  Ideally, eligibility should be based on a validated clinical tool or validated risk/needs assessment conducted by trained professionals. Examples of assessments facilitated by trained clinicians include:

 - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals/). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
 - [DAST -10](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/DAST-10.pdf) (free).
 - [NIDA’s Drug Screening Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/) (free).[^18] 
 - [Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/66_SASSI.pdf) (SASSI). 
 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^19]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).
 - [Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LSCMI)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=ls-cmi). 
 - [Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)](http://gaincc.org/instruments/).[^20]  
 - [Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS)](http://www.northpointeinc.com/files/downloads/Risk-Needs-Assessment.pdf). 
 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](http://www.uc.edu/corrections/services/trainings/offender_assessment.html) (non-propriety, but costs for training).[^21]     


----------
**Program Examples:**
The programs below have substantial and rigorous research identifying them as ***effective*** intervention programs when implemented with fidelity. This is not a comprehensive list.

**[Relapse Prevention (RP)](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/151-160.pdf)** is a CBT-based program that specifically and systematically trains individuals to engage in alternate responses to high-risk situations related to substance use.[^22]   RP incorporates the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies to reduce relapse through identification of “triggers”— individually specific high-risk situations that may precede or contribute to relapse.[^23]  Additional aspects of RP include

 - enhancing self-efficacy;
 - managing relapses;
 - identifying and coping with high-risk situations;
 - eliminating myths and placebo effects (countering misperceptions of use); and
 - balancing and modifying lifestyle factors.[^24] 

**[Contingency management (CM)](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-2/122-127.pdf)** is an incentive-based intervention with a behavioral focus that uses reinforcements to meet specific behavioral goals such as remaining clean and sober, providing negative urine screens, or completing treatment sessions.[^25]  Reinforcements shape or control behavior through consequences and non-drug-related reinforcers to help counter the reinforcing effects of drugs.[^26]  Two common types of CM programs:

* *Voucher-Based Reinforcement Therapy (VBRT)* which uses vouchers with differing monetary values each time an individual engages in specific positive behaviors that may be exchanged for goods or services.[^27]     
* *Prize-Based (PB) contingency management* which uses a drawing for a prize when an individual engages in positive behavior, but not all drawings will result in a tangible prize.[^28]   


----------
**Research findings.** Cognitive-behavioral therapies are effective types of treatment that generally have a moderate effect on reducing

 - substance use; 
 - substance abuse; and
 - reoffending.[^29]  

Further, research indicates that CBT and behavioral intervention programs can be more effective than

 - abstinence-based approaches;
 - standard case management; and
 - 12-step counseling.[^30] 

Research also suggests that behavioral therapies with CM can result in more positive outcomes than behavioral interventions alone.[^31]  

In a meta-analysis, CBT showed a 26 percent reduction in recidivism for CBT program participants compared to a control group.[^32]  Further, CBT-based programs are effective with a variety of individuals, including those with SUDs or substance abuse/misuse.[^33]  

Behavioral (including CBT) programs or interventions produce the greatest effects when they adhere to the following principles:

 - Target those at *higher-risk to recidivate* (moderate- and high-risk) based on a validated risk/needs assessment.
 - Target *criminogenic risk factors* most highly associated with recidivism based on a validated risk/needs assessment.
 - Are *responsive* to individual needs and barriers (i.e. language, mental health, intellectual or cognitive disabilities).
 - Use *well-trained* professionals.
 - Maintain *adherence to the program or practice components* (fidelity, or using a program or practice as it is meant to be delivered based on training).[^34]

## PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS: MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT)

**Description:**   [Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) programs](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment) incorporate the use of medicine to treat opioid or alcohol use disorders, in conjunction with behavioral therapies or counseling to treat individuals with SUDs.[^35]  With regard to opioids, the use of medication alone is called opioid replacement therapy (ORT), which alone, can also be effective to treat opioid use disorders (OUDs).[^36] MAT programs help with treatment retention and abstinence by decreasing withdrawal symptoms and cravings; increasing quality of life; reducing risk of HIV and hepatitis C; reducing risky behaviors associated with substance use; as well as decreasing risk for overdose.[^37]   MAT programs can be in the community [healthcare office, methadone maintenance clinic, primary care physicians’ office, certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs)] or [correctional settings](http://nicic.gov/topics/5288-medication-assisted-treatment-mat-in-corrections).[^38]  Each type of medication for MAT is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and is most effective when coupled with other counseling or therapy services for SUDs.[^39]  

***Medications to treat Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs)***  
**[Buprenporphine](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/buprenorphine)** offers a partial opioid agonist, producing similar, but lessened, effects of opiates. To increase the safety of buprenorphine and decrease the likelihood of diversion or misuse, naloxone—an opioid receptor blocker—is added to the medication.[^40]  Medications include 

 - Bunavail® (buccal film);
 - Suboxone® (film);
 - Zubsolv® (sublingual tablets);
 - Subutex® (transmucosal); 
 - Buprenex® (intramuscular or intravenous; 
 - Butrans® (transdermal patch); and
 - Probuphine® (implant).[^41]   

Medication is prescribed and administered by a physician trained by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and given a special license and waiver by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The medication can be administered in an office, hospital, health department, or correctional facility.[^42]  Physicians can prescribe only to a limited number of patients—275—per the Federal Registrar, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under section 303(g)(2) of the Controlled Substances Act (CSS).[^43]  

[**Methadone**](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/methadone) uses a synthetic opioid agonist taken in pill, liquid, or water form once a day. An opioid agonist tricks the brain and body as if it were taking opiates, without adverse side effects in order to reduce physiological cravings and withdrawal symptoms.  First administered and monitored by a physician, it then can be obtained through an [opioid treatment program (OTP)](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/opioid-treatment-programs) certified by the SAMHSA.[^44]  Methadone can be addictive, so it must be taken as prescribed to prevent adverse effects.[^45] 

[**Naltrexone**](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/naltrexone) is an opioid antagonist, blocking receptors in the brain from responding to opioids (or alcohol) and comes in pill (ReVia®, Depade®) or extended-release injectable (Vivitrol®) forms.[^46]  Any healthcare professional that is licensed to prescribe medications can prescribe naltrexone, without additional training.[^47]  

However, research on the use of naltrexone for OUDs is more limited than methadone and buprenorphine, particularly regarding rigorous, generalizable, long-term evaluations. While promising, more research is needed as to long-term outcomes.[^48] 

***Medications to treat Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs)***

In addition  [**Naltrexone**](http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/treatment/naltrexone) can be used for AUDs, as it mediates or blocks the opioid activity within the brain related to alcohol use (see description above in OUDs).

**[Disulfiram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64036/)** is an alcohol abuse deterrent prescription medication taken daily in tablet form (Antabuse). When combined with alcohol, it causes severe physical reactions (i.e. heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, flushing). It is only effective if the individual is compliant with taking the medication.[^49]

**[Acamprosate](https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/MS974/MS974.pdf)** is a prescription drug taken orally (Campral®) that helps reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms by normalizing alcohol-related neurochemical changes in the brain.[^50]  It targets neurochemical systems that may be biological factors of alcohol dependence.[^51]  


----------
**Goals:**

 - Reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms related to substance use.
 - Reduce risk for overdose.
 - Reduce substance use and relapse. 
 - Increase treatment retention.
 - Decrease illegal activity.
 - Increase positive outcomes related to health (HIV, Hepatitis C).
 - Increase abstinence rates.[^52] 
 - Improve patient survival.[^53] 


----------
**Eligibility:** Individuals with opioid or alcohol use disorders may be eligible for MAT programs. Individuals should be assessed with a clinical and validated substance abuse tool that includes assessment of medical, psychiatric, and substance use history; an evaluation of family and psychosocial supports; assessment of the state’s prescription drug monitoring program for detection of unreported use of other medications; a physical exam, and testing for recent opioid use and/or other drugs.[^54]  Some examples of assessments using self-report answers facilitated by trained clinicians include:

 - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals/). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
 - [DAST -10](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/DAST-10.pdf) (free).
 - [NIDA’s Drug Screening Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/) (free).[^55]

 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^56]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).

 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](http://www.uc.edu/corrections/services/trainings/offender_assessment.html) (non-propriety, but costs for training).[^58]     

In a medical setting, [physicians can ask patients](http://www.integration.samhsa.gov/clinical-practice/mat/RAND_MAT_guidebook_for_health_centers.pdf) about compulsive drug or alcohol use or loss of control over drinking or drug use during the past year.[^59]  It is also important to consider insurance coverage related to MAT programs (specifically, for the medications) for funding purposes, or other outside funding sources including low-cost drug programs, to help supplement those who may not be covered. 


----------
**Research on medications to treat OUDs**

Methadone can

 - decrease heroin and other opioid use; 
 - decrease use of injection;
 - decrease in crime/criminal behavior;  
 - improve social functioning and physical symptoms;[^60]  and
 - improve maternal and fetal outcomes for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.[^61]


Buprenorphine can

 - significantly decrease in opioid use;
 - increase in overall well-being and social functioning;
 - reduce potential to contract HIV or hepatitis B or C;
 - decrease mortality;[^62] and 
 - decrease cravings and withdrawal symptoms.[^63]  

Naltrexone (extended-release injectable) for OUDs can

 - increase abstinence, and
 - increase retention in treatment.[^64]  

**Research on medications to treat AUDs**

Naltrexone for alcohol can

 - reduce drinking;
 - reduce rewarding effects of alcohol; and 
 - increase days abstinent.[^65] 

Disulfiram (Antabuse) can

 - be more effective than a placebo for sobriety;[^66]  
 - have a moderate effect on short-term abstinence;[^67]  
 - be most effective with those who are already motivated to stop drinking;[^68]  and
 - be most effective with close monitoring for better outcomes.[^69] 

Acomprosate can

 - decrease withdrawal symptoms; and
 - increase abstinence for those already motivated.[^70] 

Research also suggests the importance of MAT programs within correctional institutions for those transitioning from jail or prison into the community—as it can help

 - reduce recidivism;
 - increase offender engagement and retention in treatment; and
 - reduce risk for relapse and/or overdose.[^71]

## THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES (TCs)

**Description:** Therapeutic communities (TCs) in prisons and jails are peer- and staff-led, residential programs that provide substance use treatment, mental health counseling, and other health support services, with participants generally housed separate from the prison or jail’s general population.[^72]  This type of program generally lasts between 12- and 18-months, focusing on overall lifestyle changes and examination of individuals’ thinking and behavior.[^73]  Further, relapse prevention strategies, including coping and social skills, thinking and behavior awareness, as well as development of care coordination and support networks, are provided as participants’ transition for release into the community. [^74] Typically, TCs are more frequently found in prisons, but can be implemented in a jail setting.

----------
**Goals:**

 - Sustain abstinence and sobriety. 
 - Develop and maintain social and coping skills.
 - Reduce recidivism (re-arrest, re-conviction, re-incarceration).

----------
**Eligibility:** Individuals with SUDs or who misuse substance incarcerated in a jail or prison may be eligible. Eligibility varies between facilities, and may include 

 - referral to a TC by correctional staff or treatment provider;
 - voluntary participation in TC;
 - classification as a drug-involved offender; and/or 
 - deemed to have a high need area related to substance use—through a risk/needs assessment (high need on substance use) and a clinical substance use assessment in order to identify appropriate services.

Some examples of assessments using self-report answers facilitated by trained clinicians include:

**Research findings**

In a meta-analysis of 35 evaluations found incarceration-based TCs can

 - reduce rates in post-release drug use;[^79]    
 - increase time to re-incarceration; 
 - reduce levels of re-incarceration; and 
 - increase levels of employment.[^80] 

In another study of five TCs, individuals who ***did not*** participate in TCs were

 - 1.6 times more likely to be re-incarcerated, and
 - 1.5 times more likely to be re-arrested.[^81]

## CORRECTIONAL RESIDENTIAL SUBSTANCE USE AND SUD TREATMENT

**Description:**  Substance use treatment programs in state prisons and local jails integrate more comprehensive programming for those in correctional institutions, as well as offer community-based aftercare services.[^82]  Ideally, this residential substance use treatment allows incarcerated offenders separation from the general population in order to focus exclusively on substance abuse and substance-related issues. The [Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT)](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bja/206269.pdf) program, through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, grants funding to all states to administer funds for RSAT in prisons, which may incorporate MAT.[^83]   Further, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) currently implements [Residential Drug Abuse Programs (RDAP)](https://www.fd.org/docs/select-topics---bop/BOP-RDAP-Chart-6-14-10-modified.pdf) within their institutions—a nine-month, 500-hour program with separate housing, focused on substance use treatment. RDAP also incorporates Community Transition Drug Abuse Treatment/Community Treatment Services that integrates reentry services post-release.[^84]


----------
**Goals:**

 - Increase focus on recovery.
 - Increase staff and resources to address substance use and related issues.
 - Increase inmate skills to remain substance-free, gain employment, and be productive members of their communities.[^85]
 - Reduce relapse.
 - Increase continuity of care post-release.
 - Reduce inmate and detainee misconduct.
 - Reduce recidivism (re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration) and antisocial behavior;
 - Improve physical and mental health symptoms and conditions.[^86]
 - Reduce local, state, and federal government costs related to substance use and related crimes.[^87] 


----------
**Eligibility:** There is the possibility for federal funding specifically for RSAT. However, this eligibility is only for funding, though these guidelines incorporated evidence-based SUD or substance misuse/abuse treatment practices. To obtain RSAT funding, programs must

 - Be six- to 12-months long (3-months for jail-based programs);
 - provide residential facilities separate from the general jail or prison population;
 - predominately focus on SUD treatment;
 - teach inmates social, cognitive, behavioral, and vocation skills related to substance use issues; 
 - require drug and alcohol testing; and
 - run by government agencies that provide treatment to inmates.[^88] 

RDAP eligibility includes the following, per the BOP guidelines:

 - Have a documented SUD per the American Psychiatric Associations Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM).
 - DSM diagnosis within 12-months prior to arrest.
 - Sign program agreement.
 - Completion of three-component program. 
 - Have approximately 24-months left on sentence.[^89] 

Eligibility should be based on a validated clinical tool identifying a SUD or substance misuse. This can include (but is not limited to): 

  - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals/). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).
 - [DAST -10](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/DAST-10.pdf) (free).
 - [NIDA’s Drug Screening Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nmassist/) (free).[^90] 
 - [Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AssessingAlcohol/InstrumentPDFs/66_SASSI.pdf) (SASSI). 
 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^91]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).
 - [Level of Service/Case Management Inventory (LSCMI)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=ls-cmi). 
 - [Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN)](http://gaincc.org/instruments/).[^92]

 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](http://www.uc.edu/corrections/services/trainings/offender_assessment.html) (non-propriety, but costs for training).[^93] 


----------
**Research findings**

RSAT is a ***promising*** practice that can

 - decrease positive drug/alcohol tests;
 - reduce positive drug/alcohol tests; 
 - reduce positive drug/alcohol tests for aftercare clients;[^94]
 - significantly lower relapse at 6, 12, and 18 months compared to no treatment;
 - statistically lower arrest rates at 12 months compared to no treatment; and
 - significantly lower relapse, recidivism, and arrest rates for RSAT participants who completed community aftercare compared to those who did not.[^95] 

RDAP is a ***promising*** program that can, when compared to the control group

 - prolonged time to relapse;
 - lower probability of rearrest; and
 - lower probability of revocation.[^96] 


----------
**Examples in the field:** In 2015, there were approximately 132 programs funded through RSAT.

## INCARCERATION-BASED INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP SUBSTANCE USE AND SUD TREATMENT

**Description:** The same evidence-informed cognitive-behavioral therapies and MAT programs can be used in jails and prisons. Unfortunately, most prisons and jails do not have an adequate quality or quantity of treatment.[^97]  Researchers have identified several feasible corrections-based SUD and substance misuse treatment programs. 

Treatment and other services to support individuals with SUDs or other substance use issues in correctional settings include (but is not limited to):

 - Cognitive-behavioral therapy, both individual or group (see ***Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies***).
 - Individual, group, or family counseling.
 - Self-help or peer recovery support groups.
 - Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) (see ***Pharmacological Treatment*** ).
 - Educational and vocational training.[^98] 

In addition, there are residential based treatments that include: 

 - Therapeutic Communities (see ***Therapeutic Communities***).
 - Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) programs funded by the federal government (see ***Residential Correctional Treatment***). 
 - Residential Drug Abuse Programs (RDAP) (see ***Residential Correctional Treatment*** ).

Limitations and things to consider about SUD and substance use treatment in corrections:

 - Individual traumatic experiences and difficulty coping within a prison environment (potential post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms).
 - Co-occurring disorders (SUD or substance use in conjunction with another mental illness).
 - Breaking inmate identity and culture—treatment as a sign of “weakness.”
 - Gender-specific issues
 - Capacity to separate those in treatment from general population.
 - Quality assurance capacity to assess effectiveness of treatment. 
 - Capacity and quality of treatment providers.
 - Nature of the population.
 - Length of stay and estimated time of release.[^99] 


----------
**Goals:**

 - Decrease substance use. 
 - Increase connection and engagement in aftercare services upon release from jail or prison.
 - Decrease risk for overdose.
 - Decrease recidivism (re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration).


----------
**Eligibility:**  Individuals in corrections with SUDs.  Eligibility varies greatly between correctional facilities (jails and prisons). Some examples of assessments by correctional staff or clinicians to identify appropriate individuals include: 

  - [Addiction Severity Index (ASI)](http://www.tresearch.org/tools/download-asi-instruments-manuals/). 
 - [Opioid Risk Tool](https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/files/OpioidRiskTool.pdf) (free).

 - [Texas Christian University (TCU) Drug Screen II](https://ibr.tcu.edu/forms/tcu-drug-screen/).[^101]  

For professionals in the criminal justice system, a validated risk/needs assessment can help identify if substance use is a high need area for an individual, in which it may be appropriate to refer to a clinician for further assessment. Some of these validated risk/needs assessments include:

 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised: Screening Version (LSI-R:SV)](http://mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&prod=lsi-rs&id=overview).
 - [Level of Service Inventory-Revised (LSI-R)](http://www.mhs.com/product.aspx?gr=saf&id=overview&prod=lsi-r).

 - [Ohio Risk Assessment System (ORAS)](http://www.uc.edu/corrections/services/trainings/offender_assessment.html) (non-propriety, but costs for training).[^103] 


----------
**Research findings:**  Overall, incarceration-based treatment research indicates significant reductions[^104] in drug use and drug-related crime post-release.[^105]  

Overall, incarceration-based cognitive-behavioral therapy outcomes found

 - recidivism reduction (re-arrest, re-conviction, and re-incarceration);[^106]  and
 - reduction in substance use and relapse.[^107]  

Research also suggests the importance of MAT programs within correctional institutions for those transitioning from jail or prison into the community—as it can help

 - reduce recidivism;
 - increase offender engagement in treatment; and
 - reduce risk for relapse and/or overdose.[^108]

## PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS:MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT--RESEARCH UPDATE*

New research indicates patient success in the use of extended-release naltrexone (Vivitrol®) for medication-assisted treatment. While buprenorphine and methadone remain the gold standard for treatment of opioid use disorders (OUDs), naltrexone appears to have a place in treating OUDs with some success.[^109]

In a 2017 study, researchers employed a 24-week, randomized, controlled clinical trial at eight U.S. community-based inpatient services and followed up with participants as outpatients. A total of 570 participants with an OUD were randomly assigned to use Vivitrol® (n=283) or Suboxone® (n=287).

Researchers found that while both medications can be effective for treating OUDs, it was substantially more difficult to initiate patients on Vivitrol® due to the required prior detoxification period of at least three days (though this varies by individual) and opioid-negative urine screen. Full detoxification is not necessary for those inducted on Suboxone® and was not required in this study.

The study found for the 570 who agreed to take part in the study, 238 participants were assigned to take Vivitrol® and 287 participants were assigned to take Suboxone®. Researchers found: 

+ Most on Suboxone successfully initiated treatment (94 percent; n=270), while those on Vivitrol® had less success, with 72 percent successfully initiating (n=204). 
+ 65 percent of participants on Vivitrol® experienced relapse events, defined by four consecutive missing urine screens, compared to 57 percent of participants on Suboxone®.[^110]

The study found of the 474 successfully initiated individuals to treatment using Vivitrol® (n=204) or Suboxone® (n=270):

+ Similar results were seen among the participants receiving the two types of medications on outcomes of opioid-negative screens and opioid-abstinent days. 
+ Initially, those taking Vivitrol® self-reported fewer cravings; however, by 24 weeks no difference was noted between the two groups.
+ For both groups, the challenge of medication retention remained.[^111]

The results of this study aligned with a 2015 Norwegian study comparing Vivitrol® and Suboxone®.[^112] In that study, 159 adult opioid-dependent patients were randomly assigned to Vivitrol® (n=80) or Suboxone® (n=79) in a 12-week, randomized clinical trial. Of those, 71 ultimately received Vivitrol® as assigned and 72 were received Suboxone® as assigned.

Overall, researchers found:

+ Similar retention time on the medication between both groups. 
+ No difference in opioid use and adverse event outcomes between both groups.
+ Overall, there was similar short-term abstinence from illicit drugs for both groups, including illicit use. [^113]

These studies support the need for pharmacological options to treat substance use disorders when medically appropriate, including opioid use disorders. Treatment should be individualized and increased patient access is needed for all medications: methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.
