## FAMILY-BASED PREVENTION PROGRAMS

**Description:** Families are important factors in the lives of youth; parenting skills and the modeling of prosocial behavior and attitudes can influence youths’ substance use.[^1]  Factors that may increase a youth’s likelihood to exhibit antisocial behaviors, such as substance use include

 - inconsistent and harsh punishment practices;
 - lack of parental supervision and monitoring;
 - low levels of family bonding; and/or
 - high levels of family conflict.[^2]

**Goals:**

 - Increase opportunities for appropriate involvement in activities with family.
 -	Increase parental use of reinforcement and parental management skills. 
 -	Increase attachment and commitment to family.
 -	Enhance family resilience.
 -	Increase effective communication skills among family members.[^3]

**Family-Based Prevention Program Examples and Research**

 [**Guiding Good Choices (GGC)**](http://www.channing-bete.com/prevention-programs/guiding-good-choices/guiding-good-choices.html) aims to increase healthy, protective parent-youth interactions while targeting youths’ risk for early substance use using a family-competency training program. The five-session weekly program led by trained facilitators incorporates
 
 - family management skills;
 - parent-youth bonding; and
 - youth peer resistance skills. [^4]

***Research findings.*** GGC is a *promising* program; compared to a control group, youth in GGC had

 - lower alcohol initiation scores;
 - significant reduction in youth engaging in substance use;
 - lower new user proportions for intoxication and marijuana after 3.5-years; and
 - were more likely to remain drug-free at a 2-year follow-up if they had not initiated substance use at 1-year follow-up.[^5] 

[**Strengthening Families Program (SFP)**](https://www.strengtheningfamiliesprogram.org/) targets family protective factors and resiliency through a seven-session program led by trained facilitators to decrease substance use and abuse in addition to other behavioral problems.[^6]  The program aims to

 - build parental skills;
 - create stronger family units; and
 - increase social, emotional, communication, conflict resolution, and coping skills.[^7]

***Research findings.*** SFP is a *promising* program; youth in SFP had

 - slower overall growth in substance use among adolescents;[^8] 
 - increased parenting competency;[^9]  
 - lower substance use behaviors when compared to the control group;[^10]  
 - delayed onset of substance use;[^11]  and
 - lower likelihood of substance use initiation at 2.5-year follow-up when youth had not initiated substance use at 1.5-year follow-up.[^12]  

[**Creating Lasting Family Connections (CLFC)**](http://copes.org/) targets families and at-risk youth in high-risk environments to increase youth resiliency and reduce substance use.[^13]  The program aims to

 - educate on drugs and alcohol; 
 - increase communication and conflict resolution skills; 
 - enhance coping and resistance skills; 
 - encourage use of community services; and 
 - improve self-knowledge, personal responsibility, and respect for others.[^14]  

CLFC can be implemented in schools, places of worship, recreation centers, or through court-based services. [^15]

***Research findings.*** CLFC is a *promising* program; at 3- and 12-months, CLFC reduced substance use frequency. [^16] When family pathology decreased, CLFC participants demonstrated reduction in frequency of other drug use and alcohol use at a 12-month follow-up.[^17]

[**Brief Strategic Family Therapy (BSFT)**](http://www.brief-strategic-family-therapy.com/) targets substance use and other antisocial behaviors for diverse populations.[^18]  A trained therapist uses a curriculum and leads 8 to 24 sessions to target family patterns that support problem behavior.[^19]  BSFT aims to

 - join youth, family, and therapist; 
 - examine patterns associated with antisocial youth behavior; and
 - restructure family’ interaction patterns.[^20] 

***Research findings.*** BSFT is a *promising* program. BSFT has reduced

 - youth substance abuse, conduct problems; 
 - maladaptive family functioning;
 - antisocial peer associations;[^21] 
 - decreased alcohol use;[^22]  and 
 - significantly reduced marijuana use.[^23] 

[**Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT)**](http://www.mdft.org/) can be used in a residential or outpatient setting, and targets substance use and other behavioral issues, while also improving overall family functioning.[^24]  Trained therapists work with the individual, parents/guardians, and other family members to 

 - improve family conflict-resolution strategies; 
 - improve family relationships and management practices;
 - transforming lifestyle to a more developmentally appropriate lifestyle; and
 - enhance protective factors.[^25]  

Sessions are delivered between 1 and 3 times per week over a 4- to 6-month time-frame.[^26]

***Research findings.*** MDFT is an *effective* program; compared to individual cognitive-behavioral therapy, MDFT can significantly

 - reduce substance use problem severity at 6- and 12-month follow-ups;
 - reduce drug use after 12 months; and
 - better outcomes for youth with co-occurring disorders.[^27] 

MDFT has also been found to

 - increase school functioning—returning to school and receiving higher grades;
 - reduce antisocial behaviors related to substance use (delinquency); and
 - reduce antisocial behaviors and association with antisocial peers.[^28] 

[**Multisystemic Therapy (MST)**](http://mstservices.com/) aims to 

 - reduce criminal activity among youth; 
 - decrease other types of antisocial behavior like drug abuse; and 
 - achieve these outcomes cost-effectively by decreasing rates of incarceration and out-of-home placements.[^29]  

Trained therapists target individual risk factors using a holistic approach in order to enhance protective factors of the individual and family.[^30]  MST programs are a minimum of 3 months with gradual decrease in contact.[^31] 

***Research findings.*** MST is an *effective* program. MST has been effective with

 - inner-city juvenile offenders and their families; 
 - parent-child relationships;
 - adolescent sexual offenders; and 
 - individual substance use and abuse.[^32]  

Research indicates MST can effectively 

 - reduce delinquency;
 - reduce reports of drug use;
 - decrease alcohol use at 4- and 12-month follow-ups; and
 - decrease in multiple drug use at 12-month follow-ups.[^33] 

Other effective evidence-informed family therapies include [**Functional Family Therapy (FFT)**](http://www.fftllc.com/), [**Treatment Foster Care Oregon**](http://www.tfcoregon.com/), and [**Nurse-Family Partnership**](https://www.nursefamilypartnership.org/).

## SCHOOL-BASED PREVENTION PROGRAMS
**Description**: These programs target factors related to youth substance use, including peers and attachment to conventional institutions (e.g. school, community), as well as opportunities like leisure activities, religious organizations.[^34]  

**Goals:**

 - Increase engagement in school. 
 - Develop and maintain relationships with teachers, peers, and other mentors.
 - Increase involvement in prosocial activities.
 - Increase positive behavior.
 - Reduce drug use and other antisocial behaviors.[^35] 


----------


### School-Based Prevention Programs Examples and Research

[**Project Towards No Drug Abuse (TND)**](http://tnd.usc.edu/about.php) is a high school-based program targeting youth risk for substance use. The program can be a universal program or selective. A trained teacher uses a curriculum focusing on

 - social skills training; 
 - decision-making components; and 
 - motivation to not use drugs.[^36] 

Students engage in games, worksheets, group discussions, and watch videos. The program targets substance use, violent behavior, and other behavioral problems.[^37]

***Research findings.*** TND is an *effective* program that has

 - reduced drug use by 25 percent;[^38]
 - reduced  monthly marijuana use by 22 percent;
 - reduced monthly drug use by 26 percent;[^39]  and
 - reduced monthly hard drug use continued for 4- and 5-years.[^40] 

[**Positive Action (PA)**](https://www.positiveaction.net/) targets youth’s intrinsic motivation to develop and maintain positive behaviors.[^41]  The program can address

 - substance use; 
 - violence-related behavior;
 - positive social-emotional learning; and 
 - youth development.[^42] 

Lessons include a focus on

 - social and emotional skills;
 - self-improvement;
 - responsibility; and
 - how thinking influences behavior.[^43] 

School administrators, faculty, or other school personnel may be trained to deliver scripted lessons.[^44] 

***Research findings.*** PA is an *effective* program; when compared to a control group, youth in PA had

 - 31 percent fewer substance use behaviors; and
 - 37 percent fewer violence-related behaviors.[^45]

Length of time in PA matters. Youth who completed PA for 3 to 4 years had significantly fewer antisocial behaviors, including substance use, than youth in PA for less than 3 years.[^46]

[**Good Behavior Game (GBG)**](http://goodbehaviorgame.org/) targets aggressive and disruptive classroom behavior, as well as future delinquency, in grades K -3, by using a reward system to reinforce compliance with classroom rules and expectations.[^47]

***Research findings.*** GBG is a *promising* program that can

 - reduce externalizing behavior and problems;
 - increase acceptance by peers; 
 - increase mutual friends; and 
 - increase closeness to others compared to non-GBG participants.[^48]


[**LifeSkills Training (LST)**](https://www.lifeskillstraining.com/) has trained school staff lead a curriculum to target key social and psychological factors that increase risk for substance use through cognitive-behavioral skills training techniques.[^49]   This includes

 - modeling (demonstration) and behavioral rehearsal (practice);
 - feedback;
 - reinforcement; and 
 - behavioral homework assignments.[^50]  

The program develops skills in

 - drug resistance (peers, media, misconceptions); 
 - personal self-management (self-image and behavior, how decisions influence others; problem-solving skills); and 
 - interpersonal and understanding choices.[^51] 

***Research findings.*** LST is an effective program for diverse populations (rural, urban, suburban, varying races). LST has demonstrated decreased

- binge drinking; 
- polysubstance use;
- lower weekly use of cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol; and 
- decreased substance use initiation.[^52]

[**Brief Alcohol Screening Intervention for College Students (BASIC)**](https://www.uhs.umich.edu/BASICS) targets college students who drink heavily and at-risk for potential alcohol-related issues (e.g. lack of class attendance, missed/late assignments, incidents, sexual assault, or violent behavior).[^53]  Trained facilitators use a harm reduction approach, incorporating cognitive-behavioral components, to increase healthier choices and provide information on use of coping skills to reduce risk.[^54] 

***Research findings.*** BASIC is an *effective* program that can

 - decrease levels of drinking and binge drinking behavior; 
 - decrease number of drinks per drinking occasion; 
 - reduce blood-alcohol content levels;[^55]   
 - reduce quantity and frequency of alcohol use after 4-years;[^56]  and
 - decrease negative consequences associated with drinking when compared to a control group.[^57] 


----------
## MULTI-MODAL PREVENTION PROGRAMS

**Description:** Many programs identified previously incorporate more than one mode of prevention, though tend to focus on one in particular. Multi-modal programs incorporate several components—community, school, family, and individual—to target for substance use prevention. Below are other prevention programs defined as multi-modal.[^58]

**Goals:**

 - Increase protective factors and youth resiliency. 
 - Decrease risk factors.
 - Decrease substance use.


----------
### Multi-Modal Prevention Program Examples and Research

[**Raising Healthy Children (RHC)**](http://www.sdrg.org/rhcsummary.asp) incorporates teacher, parent, and student components to increase socially and developmentally appropriate behaviors.[^59] This includes workshops and sessions in each component area to help enhance protective factors and reduce risk factors related to substance use and other antisocial behaviors.[^60]

Teachers work on

 - positive classroom management; 
 - cooperative learning tactics; 
 - practices to increase student motivation; 
 - interpersonal skill development; and
 - other educational strategies.[^61]  

***Research findings.*** RHC is a *promising* program that can

 - significantly improve school grades and achievement; 
 - reduce reports of violent behavior; and 
 - reduce reports of heavy alcohol use within the previous year.[^62] 

[**Communities That Care (CTC)**](http://www.sdrg.org/ctcresource/Prevention%20Strategies%20Guide/introduction.pdf) is a community-based prevention approach that targets youth health and behavioral issues through focusing on scientifically validated risk and protective factors.[^63]  The program includes five key components:

 - *Opportunities*: creation of developmentally acceptable opportunities for positive and active participation and interaction with other prosocial individuals.
 - *Skills*: teaching skills necessary for successful development.
 - *Recognition*: providing praise and reinforcement for participation, improvement, and achievement.
 - *Bonding*: Increase youths’ sense of attachment, emotional bonding, and commitment to prosocial individuals and groups in the community (i.e. family, teachers, employers, neighbors, mentors).
 - *Clear standards for behavior:* increasing motivation to live within healthy standards of the group or person whom they are bonded to.[^64] 

These key components are developed and implemented by a community coalition who designs the strategic prevention plan based on risk and protective factors most important to the community.

***Research findings.*** CTC is a *promising* program. A large-scale research study using a randomized controlled trial found CTC participants were

 - 32 percent less likely to have initiated alcohol use;
 - 25 percent less likely to have initiated delinquent behavior; 
 - 33 percent less likely to have initiated cigarette use; and
 - maintained these behaviors through 10th grade.[^65] 

Another study found lower levels of risk factors, including delinquency and alcohol/drug use in CTC communities.[^66] 

[**Positive Family Support (PFS)**](https://reachinstitute.asu.edu/family-check-up/program-overview) targets at-risk youth using a multilevel, family-centered approach that is adaptable and flexible to different family needs. PFS consists of 3 levels administered in a middle school setting:

 - Creation of a Family Resource Center (FRC) using a Parent Consultant, and implementation of Success, Health, and Peace (SHAPe).
 - Incorporation of brief interventions, with collaboration from parents for youth demonstrating signs of academic or behavioral problems not met in level 1. 
 - Family-checkups for students not responding as well to level 2, which aims to enhance parent motivation and increase family engagement in interventions.[^67] 

***Research findings.*** PFS is a *promising* program shown to

 - reduce substance use;
 - reduce antisocial behavior; 
 - reduce arrests;[^68]  
 - increase self-regulation;
 - decrease substance use over time;
 - decrease growth in antisocial behavior; and
 - reduce associations with antisocial peers.[^69]  

[**Linking the Interests of Families and Teachers (LIFT)**](http://www.childtrends.org/programs/linking-the-interests-of-families-and-teachers-lift/) targets at-risk youth and families via class-based social skill development, playground Good Behavior Game (GBG), and parent management training.[^70]  There is a LIFT telephone line in each classroom that allows for youth or families to use for questions or concerns, while also allowing teachers to provide information on the class daily.[^71] 

***Research findings.*** LIFT is an *effective* program, most notable for its impact on aggressive behavior. LIFT youth participants compared to non-LIFT youth participants indicated a

 - slowed down rate of substance use over adolescence; and
 - significant decrease in  average use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use through 12th grade.[^72]
