In any type of program, practice, or initiative for individuals with SUDs, it is imperative that they are evidence-informed, meaning that rigorous evaluation and research proves the practices and program components have produced significant, replicable positive outcomes. Implementing these programs and practices with a high degree of fidelity can help improve and save lives as well as improve public safety and decrease taxpayer and criminal justice system expenses.[^1]  In fact, for every \$1 spent on SUD treatment, there is in an estimated \$4 to \$7 return in the form of reduced drug-related crime, and criminal justice costs, and health care cost savings.[^2]  Criminal justice professionals, in conjunction with other policymakers, stakeholders, and providers, can be more effective at reducing recidivism and substance use with limited resources when they use initiatives that have been shown to work. This continuum outlined several ways in which schools, communities, families, law enforcement, courts and supervision, and correctional institutions can refer, divert, and treat individuals with SUDs, based on evidence-informed practices and offered research, resources, and examples.

There are several important things to consider prior to and during implementation of SUD and substance misuse treatment:

 1. Capacity and quality of SUD treatment and services in communities and in correctional institutions, in addition to the use of evidence-informed practices.[^3]  
 2. Net-widening—the potential to inadvertently increase the number of individuals under criminal justice control that would not otherwise have been under criminal justice control.[^4] 
 3. Collaboration between different criminal justice professionals, treatment and service providers, policymakers, and stakeholders is necessary for successful deflection, diversion, and intervention.[^5] 
 4. Criminal justice professionals should be formally trained in behavioral health and mental health, with an understanding of SUDs.[^6] 
 5. Continuing research regarding current and new SUD and substance use treatment and service models; many practices do not have enough research to consider them evidence-based, only evidence-informed.[^7] 
 6. Despite the evidence, participation or use of evidence-informed programs or practices may not be adequate to address all of an individuals’ needs. Thus, it is important to consider multi-model, individualized treatment plans when implementing SUD and substance use treatment.[^8]  
 7. Make sure that a program or practice is an appropriate fit and addresses a relevant need in the community.[^9] 
 8. Plan out the initial implementation and what sustainability may necessitate (i.e. funds, programming, staff, training) for successful implementation and sustainability.[^10] 
 9. Implementation is a process that takes time. Collect data to inform your organization about what is going on, what changes may be necessary, and assess whether there is fidelity to the practice (quality assurance processes, continuous quality improvement). This is key for sustainability.[^11]
